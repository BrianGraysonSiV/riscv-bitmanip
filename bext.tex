\chapter{RISC-V XBitmanip Extension}

In the proposals provided in this section, the C code examples are for
illustration purposes. They are not optimal implementations, but are
intended to specify the desired functionality.

The sections on encodings are mere placeholders.

\section{Count Leading Zeros (\texttt{clz})}

This operation counts the number of 0 bits before the first 1 bit
(counting from the most significant bit) in the source register. This is
related to the ``integer logarithm''. It takes a single register as
input and operates on the entire register. If the input is 0, the output is
XLEN. If the input is \textasciitilde{}0, the output is 0.

\begin{verbatim}
uint_xlen_t clz(uint_xlen_t rs1)
{
    for (int count = 0; count < XLEN; count++)
        if ((rs1 << count) >> (XLEN-1))
            return count;
    return XLEN;
}
\end{verbatim}

\input{bextclz.tex}

One possible encoding for \texttt{clz} is as a standard I-type opcode somewhere
in the brownfield surrounding the shift-immediate instructions.

% \subsection{Related Pseudo-instructions}
%
% The common operation of `finding the index of the highest bit set' (also called
% \texttt{ilog2} or \texttt{bsr} or \texttt{find\ last\ set}) is computed as
% \texttt{XLEN-clz(rs1)}.
%
% Counting trailing zeros is easily implemented by combining \texttt{clz} with
% the \texttt{grevi} instruction.
%
% \subsection{Criteria}
%
% The criteria evaluation is shown below:
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
%   These operations all fit easily into the RISCV instruction encoding
%   and philosophy.
% \item
%   The hardware to implement them is fairly simple, and can be done in a
%   logarithmic number of stages in parallel.
% \item
%   They all have current compiler and standard library support, and are
%   standardized intrinsics in many of those.
% \item
%   The threshold criteria gets a little complicated: Every one of these
%   operations can be implemented in 2-3 instructions in terms of
%   each-other, so we only need one of them in hardware, and the rest can
%   be pseudo-instructions.
% \end{itemize}
%
% However, implementing any of these instructions can also be done with a
% combination of \texttt{ctz} and a bitwise reverse (\texttt{brev}) in 1-2
% instructions. Similarly, \texttt{ctz} can be implemented in terms of
% these functions with a \texttt{brev} in 1-2 instructions.
%
% Without \texttt{brev} AND \texttt{ctz}, however, there is no simple way
% to construct this without a lot of instructions. The algorithm above in
% C is a nearly asymptotically optimal implementation. It seems to pass
% the threshold criteria in this case.
%
% \paragraph{Benchmarks and Applications}
%
% TBD

\section{Count Bits Set (\texttt{pcnt})}

The purpose of this instruction is to compute the number of 1 bits in a
register. It takes a single register as input and operates on the entire
register.

This operation counts the total number of set bits in the register.

\begin{verbatim}
uint_xlen_t pcnt(uint_xlen_t rs1)
{
    int count = 0;
    for (int index = 0; index < XLEN; index++)
        count += (rs1 >> index) & 1;
    return count;
}
\end{verbatim}

\input{bextpcnt.tex}

One possible encoding for \texttt{pcnt} is as a standard I-type opcode somewhere
in the brownfield surrounding the shift-immediate instructions.

% Implementation Commentary
%
% \texttt{pcnt} can be implemented in parallel, similarly to an adder.
%
% \subsection{Related Pseudo-Instructions}
%
% \begin{verbatim}
% //odd parity
% parity rOut,rIn:
%     pcnt rPopulation,rIn
%     andi rOut,rPopulation,0x1
% \end{verbatim}
%
% \subsection{Extensions: \texttt{pcnt.w} (R64I+), \texttt{pcnt.d} (R128I+)}
%
% On RV64B+, the appropriate versions of pcnt that operate on sub-portions
% of the register are defined. On these platforms, the input source is set
% to zero for the high portions of the register. See \texttt{addi.w} and
% \texttt{addi.d} in the R64I/R128I specifications.
%
% \subsection{Justification}
%
% This operation is one of the `core' bitwise instructions that is nearly
% universal on other ISAs. It is supported as an intrinsic on GCC, LLVM,
% and MSVC, and is supported in hardware on a plethora of platforms.

\section{Generalized Reverse (\texttt{grev,\ grevi})}

The purpose of this instruction is to provide a single hardware
instruction that can implement all of byte-order swap, bitwise reversal,
short-order-swap, word-order-swap (RV64I), nibble-order swap, bitwise
reversal in a byte, etc, all from a single hardware instruction. It
takes in a single register value and an immediate that controls which
function occurs, through controlling the levels in the recursive tree at
which reversals occur.

This operation iteratively checks each bit immed\_i from i=0 to XLEN-1,
in XLEN stages, and if the corresponding bit of the `function\_select'
immediate is true for the current stage, swaps each adjacent pair of
2\^{}i bits in the register.

\texttt{grevi} `butterfly' implementation in C on various architectures

\begin{verbatim}
uint32_t grevi32(uint32_t rs1, int12_t immed)
{
    uint32_t x = rs1;
    uint5_t k = (uint12_t)immed;
    if (k &  1) x = ((x & 0x55555555) << 1) | ((x & 0xAAAAAAAA) >> 1);
    if (k &  2) x = ((x & 0x33333333) << 2) | ((x & 0xCCCCCCCC) >> 2);
    if (k &  4) x = ((x & 0x0F0F0F0F) << 4) | ((x & 0xF0F0F0F0) >> 4);
    if (k &  8) x = ((x & 0x00FF00FF) << 8) | ((x & 0xFF00FF00) >> 8);
    if (k & 16) x = ((x & 0x0000FFFF) <<16) | ((x & 0xFFFF0000) >> 16);
    return x;
}

uint64_t grevi64(uint32_t rs1, int12_t immed)
{
    uint64_t x = rs1;
    uint6_t k = (uint12_t)immed;
    if (k &  1) x = ((x & 0x5555555555555555) << 1) | ((x & 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA) >> 1);
    if (k &  2) x = ((x & 0x3333333333333333) << 2) | ((x & 0xCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC) >> 2);
    if (k &  4) x = ((x & 0x0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F) << 4) | ((x & 0xF0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0) >> 4);
    if (k &  8) x = ((x & 0x00FF00FF00FF00FF) << 8) | ((x & 0xFF00FF00FF00FF00) >> 8);
    if (k & 16) x = ((x & 0x0000FFFF0000FFFF) <<16) | ((x & 0xFFFF0000FFFF0000) >> 16);
    if (k & 32) x = ((x & 0x00000000FFFFFFFF) <<32) | ((x & 0xFFFFFFFF00000000) >> 32);
    return x;
}
\end{verbatim}

The above pattern should be intuitive to understand in order to extend
this definition in an obvious manner for RV128+.

\input{bextgrev.tex}

\texttt{grev} is encoded as standard R-type opcode and \texttt{grevi} is
encoded as standard I-type opcode.

\section{Shift Ones (Left/Right) (\texttt{slo,\ sloi,\ sro,\ sroi})}

These instructions are similar to shift-logical operations from the base
spec, except instead of shifting in zeros, it shifts in ones. This can
be used in mask creation or bit-field insertions, for example.

These instructions are exactly the same as the equivalent logical shift
operations, except the shift shifts in ones values.

\begin{verbatim}
uint_xlen_t slo(uint_xlen_t rs1, uint_xlen_t rs2)
{
    int shamt = rs2 & (XLEN-1);
    return ~(~rs1 << shamt);
}

uint_xlen_t sloi(uint_xlen_t rs1, int12_t immed)
{
    int shamt = immed & (XLEN-1);
    return ~(~rs1 << shamt);
}

uint_xlen_t sro(uint_xlen_t rs1, uint_xlen_t rs2)
{
    int shamt = rs2 & (XLEN-1);
    return ~(~rs1 >> shamt);
}

uint_xlen_t sroi(uint_xlen_t rs1, int12_t immed)
{
    int shamt = immed & (XLEN-1);
    return ~(~rs1 >> shamt);
}
\end{verbatim}

\input{bextsxo.tex}

\texttt{s(l/r)o(i)} is encoded similarly to the logical shifts in the
base spec. However, the spec of the entire family of instructions is
changed so that the high bit of the instruction indicates the value to
be inserted during a shift. This means that a \texttt{sloi} instruction
can be encoded similarly to an \texttt{slli} instruction, but with a 1
in the highest bit of the encoded instruction. This encoding is
backwards compatible with the definition for the shifts in the base
spec, but allows for simple addition of a ones-insert.

When implementing this circuit, the only change in the ALU over a
standard logical shift is that the value shifted in is not zero, but is
a 1-bit register value that has been forwarded from the high bit of the
instruction decode. This creates the desired behavior on both logical
zero-shifts and logical ones-shifts.

%
% On RV64B+, the appropriate versions of shift-ones that operate on

\section{Rotate (Left/Right) (\texttt{rol,\ ror,\ rori})}

These instructions are similar to shift-logical operations from the base
spec, except they shift in the values from the opposite side of the
register, in order. This is also called `circular shift'.

\begin{verbatim}
uint_xlen_t rol(uint_xlen_t rs1, uint_xlen_t rs2)
{
    int shamt = rs2 & (XLEN-1);
    return (rs1 << shamt) | (rs1 >> (XLEN-shamt));
}

uint_xlen_t ror(uint_xlen_t rs1, uint_xlen_t rs2)
{
    int shamt = rs2 & (XLEN-1);
    return (rs1 >> shamt) | (rs1 << (XLEN-shamt));
}

int_xlen_t rori(uint_xlen_t rs1, int12_t immed)
{
    int shamt = immed & (XLEN-1);
    return (rs1 >> shamt) | (rs1 << (XLEN-shamt));
}
\end{verbatim}

\input{bextrox.tex}

Rotate shift is implemented very similarly to the other shift
instructions. One possible way to encode it is to re-use the way that
bit 30 in the instruction encoding selects `arithmetic shift' when bit
31 is zero (signalling a logical-zero shift). We can re-use this so that
when bit 31 is set (signalling a logical-ones shift), if bit 31 is also
set, then we are doing a rotate. The following table summarizes the
behavior. The generalized reverse opcodes can be encoded using the
bit pattern that would otherwise encode an ``Arithmetic Left Shift''
(which is an operation that does not exist).

Additionally, the four positive bitwise operations can all be
implemented with the same ALU area (e.g.~as a single microcode
instruction) using a scheme described in the implementation commentary,
and fused versions can be implemented as well.

rs1 using extract mask in rs2.

\section{Compressed instructions (\texttt{c.not,\ c.neg,\ c.clz,\ c.brev})}

The RISC-V ISA has no dedicated instructions for bitwise inverse (\texttt{not})
and arithmetic inverse (\texttt{neg}). Instead \texttt{not} is implemented as
\texttt{xori\ rd,\ rs,\ -1} and \texttt{neg} is implemented as
\texttt{sub\ rd,\ x0,\ rs}.

In bitmanipulation code \texttt{not} and \texttt{neg} are very common operations. But
there are no compressed encodings for those operations because there is no \texttt{c.xori}
instructions and \texttt{c.sub} can not operate on \texttt{x0}.

Many bit manipulation operations that have dedicated opecodes in other ISAs
must be constructed from smaller atoms in RISC-V XBitmanip code. But
implementations might chose to implement them in a single micro-op using
macro-op-fusion. For this it can be helpful when the fused sequences are short.
\texttt{not} and \texttt{neg} are good candidates for macro-op-fusion, so
it can be helpful to have compressed opcodes for them.

Likewise, \texttt{clz} and \texttt{brev} (an alias for \texttt{grevi\ rd,\ rs,\ -1},
i.e. bitwise reversal) are very common atoms for building common bit
manipulation operations. So it is helpful to have compressed opcodes for them
as well.

For example, the equivalent to the x86 instruction \texttt{BSR} (find index of
highest set bit) can be implemented using the following 64 bit sequence that does not
spill other registers (and thus is a prime candidate for macro-op-fusion):

\begin{verbatim}
  bsr rsd:
    c.clz rsd
    c.neg rsd
    addi rsd, rsd, 32
\end{verbatim}

Likewise, the AMD TBM extension adds 10 x86 bit manipulation instructions. The equivalent
RISC-V code sequences can utilize \texttt{c.not} in half of the cases.

The compressed instructions \texttt{c.not,\ c.neg,\ c.clz,\ c.brev} must be supported by
all implementations that support the C extension and XBitmanip.

\input{bextcompr}

This four instructions fit nicely in the reserved space in C.LUI/C.ADDI16SP.
They only occupy $0.13\%$ of the $\approx15.6$ bits wide RVC encoding space.
