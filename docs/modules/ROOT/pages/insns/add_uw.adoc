== Add unsigned word

Mnemonic::
add.uw _rd_, _rIndex_, _rBase_

Encoding::
[wavedrom]

{reg:[
    { bits:  7, name: 0x3b, attr: ['OP-32'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rd' },
    { bits:  3, name: 0x0, attr: ['ADD.UW'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rs1' },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rs2' },
    { bits:  7, name: 0x04 },
]}
....

Description::
Zero extends the least significant word of _rs1_ and adds it to _rs2_
placing the sum into _rd_.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--

X(rd) = X(rs2) + EXTZ(X(rs1)[31..0];
--

Question::
 * Do we want to reserve various forms that are NOP e.g.,
   _rs1_ = _rs2_ = X0 or Move where only one input is X0?  
   We don't do this with other instructions.

Pseudo-instructions::
zext.w _rd_, _rs_ is an alias for add.uw _rd_, _rs_, zero

Question::
* NB - zext.w could be an alias for pack _rs_, zero
which do we want to use?

Code Hints:
The add.uw can be used to generate addresses to index into an
array of bytes where _rs1_ is the index and _rs2_ is the base
of the array.
