Description::
Counts the number of trailing zero bits in the least significant 32-bits of a register.
Looking at only the 32 least significant bits in register _rs_, this instruction
counts the number of contiguos 0's before the first 1, starting at the least significant
bit and moving to the more significant bits.
Returns 32, if none of the least significant 32 bits is a 1.

Operation::

val LowestSetBit32 : forall ('N : Int), 'N >= 0. bits('N) -> int

function LowestSetBit32 x = {
  foreach (i from 0 to 31 by 1 in dec)
    if [x[i]] == 0b1 then return(i) else ();
  return 32;
}

let rs = X(rs);
X[rd] = LowestSetBit32(rs);
