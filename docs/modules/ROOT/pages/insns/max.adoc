Description::
Places the larger of two signed integers (_rs1_, _rs2_) in _rD_.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
let rs1_val = X(rs1);
let rs2_val = X(rs2);

let result = if   rs1_val <_s rs2_val
    	     then rs2_val
	     else rs1_val;

X(rd) = result;
--

NOTE: The sequence `neg rD, rS; max rD, rS, rD` calculates the
absolute value of signed integers.  We recommend to schedule these as
a fusion pair (i.e. avoid scheduling other instructions between these
instructions) to allow macro-fusion to recognize these as calculating
the absolute of rS and placing it in rD.
