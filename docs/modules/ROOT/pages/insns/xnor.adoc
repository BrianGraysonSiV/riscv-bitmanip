Description:: 
Perform the bit-wise exlusive-NOR operation on _rs1_ and _rs2_.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
X(rd) = ~(X(rs1) ^ X(rs2));
--
Implementation Hint::
The XNOR can be implemented by inverting one of the inputs to the base-required XOR instruction.
This inverter could be shared with the inverter used for the andn and orn instructions.
In some implementations, the inverter on _rs2_ used for subtraction can be shared with these
inverted logical functions.
