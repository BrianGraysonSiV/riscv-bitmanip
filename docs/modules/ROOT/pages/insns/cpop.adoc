Description:: 
Counts the number of 1's (i.e., set bits) in _rs_.
Operation::
[source,sail]
--
let bitcount = 0;
let rs = X(rs);

foreach (i from 0 to (xlen - 1) in inc)
    if rs[i] == 0b1 then bitcount = bitcount + 1 else ();

X[rd] = bitcount

Comment::
This operations is known as population count, popcount, sideways sum,
bit summation, or Hamming weight.

Comment::
The GCC builtin function `__builtin_popcount (unsigned int x)`
is implemented by cpop on RV32 and by cpopw on RV64; the GCC builtin
function `__builtin_popcountl (unsigned long x)` for LP64 is
implemented by cpop on RV64.
