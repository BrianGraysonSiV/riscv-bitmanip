\section{ISA Extension Proposal Scoring Criteria}

Any proposed changes to the ISA should be evaluated or scored according
to the following criteria. Proposals which score higher according to the
criteria should be considered as higher priority than proposals that
score lower. Proposals that score consistently low should be rejected.
Each of he five categories have equal weighting and each contribute up
to 20 points toward an instructions total score from 0 to 100.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Architecture Consistency: Decisions must be consistent with RISC-V
  philosophy. ISA changes should deviate as little as possible from
  existing RISC-V standards (such as instruction encodings), and should
  not re-implement features that are already found in the base
  specification or other extensions.
\item
  Threshold Metric: The proposal should provide a \emph{significant}
  savings in terms of clocks or instructions. As a heuristic, any
  proposal should replace at least four instructions. An instruction
  that only replaces three may be considered, but only if the frequency
  of use is very high.
\item
  Data-Driven Value: Usage in real world applications, and corresponding
  benchmarks showing a performance increase, will contribute to the
  score of a proposal. A proposal will not be accepted on the merits of
  its \emph{theoretical} value alone, unless it is used in the real
  world.
\item
  Hardware Simplicity: Though instructions saved is the primary benefit,
  proposals that dramatically increase the hardware complexity and area,
  or are difficult to implement, should be penalized and given extra
  scrutiny. The final proposals should only be made if a test
  implementation can be produced.
\item
  Compiler Support: ISA changes that can be natively detected by the
  compiler, or are already used as intrinsics, will score higher than
  instructions which do not fit that criteria.
\end{itemize}

\section{B Extension Adoption Strategy}

The overall goal of this extension is pervasive adoption by minimizing
potential barriers and ensuring the instructions can mapped to the
largest number of ops, either direct or pseudo, that are supported by
the most popular processors and compilers. By adding generic
instructions and taking advantage of the RISC-V base instruction that
already operate on bits, the minimal set of instructions need to added
while at the same time enabling a rich of operations.

The instructions cover the four major categories of bit manipulation:
Count, Extract, Insert, Swap. The set supports from RV32 through future
RV1024 without new instruction formats. ``Clever'' obscure instructions
are avoided in favor of more straight forward, fast, generic ones.
Coordination with other emerging RISC-V ISA extensions groups is
required to ensure our instruction sets are architecturally consistent.
