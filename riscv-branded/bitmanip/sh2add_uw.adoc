Description::
This instruction performs an XLEN-wide addition of two addends. The first addened is _rs2_. The second addened is the unsigned value formed by extracting the least significant word of _rs1_ and shifting it left by 2 places.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--

X(rd) = EXTZ(X(rs1)[31..0] + (X(rs2) << 2);
