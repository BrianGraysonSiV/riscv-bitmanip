    { bits:  7, name: 0x3b, attr: ['OP-32'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rd' },
    { bits:  3, name: 0x2, attr: ['SH1ADD.UW'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rs1' },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rs2' },

Description::
This instruction performs an XLEN-wide addition of two addends. The first addened is _rs2_. The second addened is the unsigned value formed by extracting the least significant word of _rs1_ and shifting it left by 1 place.
Operation::
[source,sail]
--
X(rd) = EXTZ(X(rs1)[31..0]) + (X(rs2) << 2);
